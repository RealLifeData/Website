###An interdisciplinary adventure

  My journey with data started when I was a neuroscientist. I completed my Ph.D. within an interdisciplinary department that bridged biological, psychological and philosophical ideas. This is where I really started learning about data, statistics and the art of using numbers to glean insight. Specifically, I studied how the brain processed relative values of rewards by recording from neurons in live and behaving animals. I recorded neural activity on 16 channels simultaneously, and the equipment sampled the data at a rate of 40,000 times per second. This resulted in a lot of data. Some of this was signal, but most of it was noise. Figuring out how to make this data usable was a wonderful challenge. I decided that learning how to code was the best way forward, so I taught myself how to use a programming language called Matlab. I separated the signal (neural firing) from the noise using principal component analyses, and conducted a massive statistical inquiry that ultimately revealed key insights into how the brain compares one reward with another (Webber and colleagues, 2016).

  I loved the interdisciplinary aspect of my graduate work, so an interdisciplinary Postdoctoral Fellowship seemed like a natural next step. I applied for and won a position at the National Institutes of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Here I studied how the feeling of hunger is generated in the brain. This was a world class opportunity and an outstanding experience. I learned how to do a amazing things at the NIH, like a how to turn neurons on and off using light. While completing my Postdoctoral Fellowship I had the realization that working with data was my favorite part about being a scientist. So, when my contract was up I decided focus my career on data science.

  It was a daunting idea to switch fields, but I found an outstanding opportunity as the Assistant Director of Analytics for the OHSU Foundation. The Foundation had started using analytics in their development efforts, but needed someone who knew about statistics and modeling to come in and take it to the next level. They offered me the opportunity to build an analytics program for the Foundation, and I was thrilled to accept. In his role I used statistics, modeling and analytics to help raise money for biomedical research, which is a mission that will always be close to my heart. I had the privilege to support amazing individuals who raise money for research that aims to end cancer, HIV/AIDs, blindness and neurodegenerative diseases.

 From my experience with data science and philanthropy, I learned what a powerful agent for change that machine learning can really be.  I decided that I wanted to dedicate my career to helping people who want to use machine learning to change the world. I found the perfect opportunity to do this at DataRobot.  DataRobot is an automated machine learning platform that makes cutting edge machine learning accessible to everyone.  This includes businesses, nonprofits and other institutions. DataRobot a perect blend of data science, people and success.  I hope to be here for a very long time!
