#This website is about data!  

I am a scientist, and I love data.  There is a lot of publicly available data out there on the web, but we aren't using it well.  I want to try and change that.   

Because I want this page to be just about the data, I will refrain from revealing my own asshole opinions!  I want **you** to form your own asshole opinion and share it with the world!   

 

#There are 3 goals of this website: 

1.  Have fun with data.

2. Inspire people to be more curious about data.

3. Promote data literacy.  

We are in the information age, and with all this data flying around it is hard to know what is real, what is an outright lie, and what is just a well informed opinion.
