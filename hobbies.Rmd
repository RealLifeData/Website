In my free time I like to write outside of the realm of peer-review.  I write career materials, short stories and science fiction novels. They are self-published on Amazon.

##Alternative Careers in Science: A 2018 Starter's Guide to Success

Designed for people who want to get off of the tenure track, but don't know how to get started. This guide was written by a neuroscientist who left research and found success in the field of Data Science & Analytics. 


Importantly this is not an exhaustive resource on career trajectories, resume writing or networking. It is a simple, how-to guide for getting started in a fast-changing job market. Most academics lean towards reading piles of research before taking action. I argue that this is not a good strategy for blazing your own trail in 2018. You can find extensive tomes about career development on Amazon, and these offer useful, general advice on career transitions - but in my experience they were more work than they were worth. Each Ph.D. is unique, and your path is going to be unique as well. This guide provides practical, actionable advice for finding a high-value job in the dynamic job market - by someone who actually did it.

The great Pharaoh Rameses II rules over Egypt with a golden hand. The people prosper and there is peace along the Nile - or at least, that is how it appears.  


Powerful cults conspire against Rameses in the north and an ancient grudge fuels the flame. Nebi and his family get swept into a devious plot to kill the Pharaoh. His father, a Mason, is accused of a terrible crime and Nebi is forced to run for his freedom. He stumbles onto an ancient object that changes everything. He follows its' call to the Valley of the Kings and learns a shocking history of his people.

&nbsp;

Space is a very deadly place, a vacuum filled with colossal distances, impenetrable darkness and blazing balls of fire. Humans have spread so far throughout the four quadrants that they have lost touch with their origins.

Matter generators have given humanity the gift of creation but they have failed to realize its' true power. People use the technology without understanding where it came from, or how it works. 

Clandestine entities from the boundless zone smuggle the required materials into the quadrants through a small but elite group of liaisons. A contract lasting generations keeps the arrangement intact. A handful of people know where to meet these aliens to acquire the mysterious substance but no one knows where they get it or why they require payment in human slaves...

##Nature Photography
&nbsp;  

It's sometimes hard to fit everything in, but I also like to take nature pictures.

Here is a panorama that I took in the Rocky Mountains at 14,000 feet!
