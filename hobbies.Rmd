***These stories are quick to read and leave a lot to the imagination. But beware, they are not for the faint of heart...***
&nbsp; 

Humans ended up in a complicated love affair with their technology, so much so that they gave them something sacred. Each Genesis unit was given a living, beating, bleeding human heart. The only possible eventuality was total war. 
&nbsp; 

The Great Sorrow ended in a catastrophic loss of human life and tore open a gaping rift between man and machine. The Genesis units seek forgiveness because they think in it they will find their salvation - but humans have little to give in the aftermath of near extinction. 
&nbsp; 

Both humans and androids are left lost amongst each other, seeking to find themselves in a new natural order. They each have their wounds and they each have their story - but the androids have only one collective soul. Can they come to terms with their past, and design a future worth living for all?

The great Pharaoh Rameses II rules over Egypt with a golden hand. The people prosper and there is peace along the Nile - or at least, that is how it appears.  


Powerful cults conspire against Rameses in the north and an ancient grudge fuels the flame. Nebi and his family get swept into a devious plot to kill the Pharaoh. His father, a Mason, is accused of a terrible crime and Nebi is forced to run for his freedom. He stumbles onto an ancient object that changes everything. He follows its' call to the Valley of the Kings and learns a shocking history of his people.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Space is a very deadly place, a vacuum filled with colossal distances, impenetrable darkness and blazing balls of fire. Humans have spread so far throughout the four quadrants that they have lost touch with their origins.

Matter generators have given humanity the gift of creation but they have failed to realize its' true power. People use the technology without understanding where it came from, or how it works. 

Clandestine entities from the boundless zone smuggle the required materials into the quadrants through a small but elite group of liaisons. A contract lasting generations keeps the arrangement intact. A handful of people know where to meet these aliens to acquire the mysterious substance but no one knows where they get it or why they require payment in human slaves...

##Nature Photography
&nbsp;  

It's sometimes hard to fit everything in, but I also like to take nature pictures.

Here is a panorama that I took in the Rocky Mountains at 14,000 feet!
