  I have extensive public speaking experience.  I have given 13 presentations at both national and international conferences.  I also participated in weekly seminars at Bowling Green State University and the National Institutes of Health.  I have taught formal courses and given informal talks for various lab groups.  Notably, my public speaking experiences have been almost exclusively for interdisciplinary audiences, which has allowed me to develop a presentation style that can cover very complex concepts for a broad range of listeners. 
  
  I even made an appearance on the nationally televised CBS Sunday Morning Show to demonstrate how lab rats "laugh" when you tickle them.
