  I have extensive public speaking experience.  I have given 13 presentations at both national and international conferences.  I also participated in weekly seminars at Bowling Green State University and the National Institutes of Health.  I have taught formal courses and given informal talks for various lab groups. I have also given organization wide presentations to teach colleauges across departments how to incorporate machine learning and other analytic tools into day-to-day operations.  
  
  &nbsp;
Notably, my public speaking experiences have been almost exclusively for interdisciplinary audiences. This has allowed me to develop a presentation style that can cover very complex concepts for a broad range of listeners. 
  
  I even made an appearance on the nationally televised CBS Sunday Morning Show to demonstrate how lab rats "laugh" when you tickle them.

### Public Outreach

  In addition to my professional pubic speaking, I regularly do outreach events where I engage the community regarding science and professional development.  These include volunteering for STEM in the Park and Brain Awareness Week.

Most recently, I volunteered to mentor Postdoctoral Fellows at the Oregon Health and Science University on alternative careers.  [See Article](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/news-and-events/postdocs-outside-academia.cfm)
