I created an interactive dashboard that allows you to explore exactly what the 113th national congress was able to accomplish.  There is an overview of bills proposed, by what party and the outcomes.  There is also an analysis that examines the productivity of both bodies througout the year. 

For a deeper dive, there is an exportable table that gives the details of the bills you segmented with the filters.  Enjoy!

There has been a lot of talk of immigration and the job market recently, so I thought I'd take a quick look to see what the data says about this. 

Data was obtained from a variety of sources:

A friend of mine recently asked me what seemed like a fairly simple question: where are all of the single men?  I was working with census data for my work, so I decided to look into it and share the results! 

This document displays data taken from publicly available 2014 census records. Here is a link to get started with Census data [here](https://www.factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml).
