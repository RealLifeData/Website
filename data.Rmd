A friend of mine recently asked me what seemed like a fairly simple question: where are all of the single men?  I was working with census data for my work, so I decided to look into it and share the results! 

This document displays data taken from publicly available 2014 census records. Here is a link to get started with Census data [here](https://www.factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml).
