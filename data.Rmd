Scott Pruitt's e-mails were recently released.  I went ahead and did some very basic text analytics on the data.  Enjoy! (or don't, it's really up to you)

Data:  The PDF originals were too large to put onto GitHub, so if you want those files you must download them yourself from [here](http://www.exposedbycmd.org/Scott-Pruitt-Missing-Emails).  The R code can be found on my [GitHub site](https://github.com/RealLifeData).  

##They took our jobs!

There has been a lot of talk of immigration and the job market recently, so I thought I'd take a quick look to see what the data says about this. 

Data was obtained from a variety of sources:

A friend of mine recently asked me what seemed like a fairly simple question: where are all of the single men?  I was working with census data for my work, so I decided to look into it and share the results! 

This document displays data taken from publicly available 2014 census records. Here is a link to get started with Census data [here](https://www.factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml).
